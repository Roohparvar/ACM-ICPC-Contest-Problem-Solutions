# ACM-ICPC Contest Problem Solutions

The ACM-ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among universities worldwide. It is recognized as one of the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contests in the world. The challenges posed in these contests not only focus on programming but also emphasize problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

For anyone who wants to learn programming, improve their problem-solving skills, or develop algorithmic thinking, solving these challenges is a great resource. The problems presented in these contests are not just about coding but also encourage deep analytical and algorithmic approaches to solutions.

The goal of creating this repository is to draw students' attention to these contests and the challenges they offer. Below are some websites where you can find a variety of contest problems to challenge yourself:

- ðŸ’Ž [vjudge.net](https://vjudge.net/)

In this repository, we present four simple exercises from ACM contests, each accompanied by the problem statement (as an image) and the solution written in C++. These problems will help you get familiar with the types of questions posed in these contests:

1. **Fox Snake**
2. **Group Reverse Problem**
3. **Jolly Problem**
4. **Watermelon Problem**
